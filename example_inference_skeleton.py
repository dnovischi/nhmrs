"""MADDPG-style inference skeleton for NHMRS simple_assignment environment.

Goal
====
Provide a clear, framework-agnostic guide for running inference with a trained
MADDPG policy on the ``simple_assignment_v0`` environment. This focuses on how
to wire actors per agent, act deterministically, and interact with the env.

Important: This file deliberately contains NO deep learning imports so it runs
everywhere. Replace the loader/actor placeholders with your framework (PyTorch,
TF, JAX) to actually load weights and produce actions.

Quickstart
==========
    python example_inference_skeleton.py

What happens at inference (MADDPG)
==================================
- Only the actors are needed (one actor per agent). Centralized critics are not
  used during execution.
- For each agent i, given o_i, compute a_i = pi_i(o_i) and clip to the action
  bounds from env.action_space(agent_i).
- Use deterministic actions (no exploration noise) for evaluation.

Environment primer (simple_assignment)
======================================
- Observation per agent: [own_x, own_y, own_theta, landmarks..., other_agents...]
  Size = 3 + 2*M + 3*(N-1)
- Action per agent: continuous control, e.g., unicycle [v, omega]
- Episode ends by truncation at max_steps (no early termination)
- Rendering: set RENDER_MODE='human' for a window, or 'rgb_array' for offscreen.

# =============================================================================
# Tips for integrating your trained MADDPG actors
# =============================================================================
# 1) Replace MADDPGActor with your model class; implement .act(obs) to return
#    deterministic actions. For DDPG-style actors, no sampling is used.
# 2) Implement load_actor(...) to restore model weights from disk; return an
#    instance per agent. Ensure actors are put in eval/inference mode.
# 3) Maintain a consistent agent ordering. The env uses names like 'agent_0',
#    'agent_1', ...; your training code should save each agent's actor weights
#    with names that match env.possible_agents to avoid mismatches.
# 4) Always clip the output actions to env.action_space(agent).low/high.
# 5) To record video without a display, set RENDER_MODE='rgb_array' and collect
#    frames from env.render(); save them via imageio/moviepy if desired.
